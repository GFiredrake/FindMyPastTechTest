Set up:

*Pull solution

*set up solution on local IIS on port 5050

Things I'm happy with: the fact i was able to keep the program very small yet still powerful enough to deal with large numbers.

Things I'd do with more time: wrap more tests around some parts and redactor the deprecated tests while re factoring a little of the code just to give it a little more separation.
